# 👋 Hi, I'm Jiyoon

Backend Developer focused on **transaction processing systems** and **core financial logic**.

I am interested in how financial systems guarantee **atomicity, consistency, and data integrity** under concurrent transaction environments.  
Through implementing core banking features and migrating legacy systems, I have developed a strong interest in building reliable and maintainable financial software.

# 💳 FinFlow-backend

**Repository:** https://github.com/zzzyoonnn/FinFlow-backend

A backend application that simulates core banking operations with a focus on transactional integrity.

Designed and implemented essential banking operations including:

- Deposit  
- Withdrawal  
- Transfer  
- Transaction history management  

## 🔎 Design Approach

- Managed withdrawal and transfer operations within a single `@Transactional` boundary to ensure **atomicity**
- Delegated validation logic (ownership, password verification, balance checks) to the **Account domain entity**
- Prevented negative balances through explicit business rule enforcement
- Recorded transaction history with **balance snapshots at the time of execution** for auditability
- Structured flow clearly as: **validation → state mutation → persistence → response**

Through this implementation, I became particularly interested in how financial systems prevent data inconsistency, race conditions, and double execution under concurrent requests.

# 🔄 Servlet2Spring

**Repository:** https://github.com/zzzyoonnn/Servlet2Spring

This project reflects my growth in understanding backend architecture evolution and framework-driven design.

Started with a JSP-based architecture and progressively evolved it into Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

## 🔎 Migration Focus

- Refactored the application into a clearer layered architecture
- Improved separation of concerns between controller, service, and domain layers
- Simplified configuration using Spring Boot auto-configuration
- Enhanced security structure using Spring Security
- Reduced boilerplate code and improved maintainability
- Improved deployment and dependency management with Maven

This migration process taught me the importance of modernizing systems **without compromising stability**, especially in environments where reliability is critical.

# 💡 What I Aim to Build

I aim to build backend systems where correctness and reliability are prioritized over feature speed — especially in domains where data integrity is critical.
